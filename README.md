# Copy-Paste AnimationCurves
A simple editor script that adds copy-paste functionality to Unity's AnimationCurve fields. Simply add this script into any of your `Editor` folders or create one if one doesn't exist yet (default: `/Assets/Editor`). After Unity recompiles you can right-click on any Animation Curve field to copy or paste it.

The properties copied over are:

- Keyframes
- Prewrap mode
- Postwrap mode
